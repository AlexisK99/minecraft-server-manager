# Managing DockerHub

The Network Cobwebs DockerHub is at
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/networkcobwebs/minecraft-server-manager

Two groups have been created to manage the repository: dev and release

Users in the dev group should only create Minecraft Server Manager Docker images tagged with a `dev`
tag.

Users in the release group should be able to manage the `latest` and other released tags of the 
Minecraft Server Manager Docker image.
